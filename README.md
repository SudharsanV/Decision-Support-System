# Decision-Support-System
Created a model to predict Breast Cancer using text data.
The model was developed using Recurrent Neural Networks and Multi-layer Perceptron with the help of Term Frequency and Inverse Document  Frequency techniques.
Implemented using Python, Keras and Tensorflow followed by the comparison of performance measures.
